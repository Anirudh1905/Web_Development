                    Anirudh made his debut as a music composer in his cousin Aishwarya R. Dhanush's directorial debut 3, starring Dhanush. While pursuing his degree at Loyola College, he had done background scores for the short films made by Aishwaryaa and his work on short films convinced her to have him work on her first commercial venture.[13] In early November 2011, a leaked version of a song from the film Why This Kolaveri Di!, circulated online and the film's team decided to subsequently release it officially on 16 November 2011. It instantly became viral on social networking sites for its quirky "Tanglish" (portmanteau word of Tamil and English) and foot-tapping kuthu beats.[14] Soon, the song became the most searched YouTube video in India and internet phenomenon across Asia.[15][16][17][18] Within a few weeks, YouTube honoured the video with a "Recently Most Popular" Gold Medal award and "Trending" silver medal award for receiving a large number of hits in a short time.[19][20] The song was built around a South Indian folk rhythm. Its instrumentation consists of nadaswaram, shehnai, saxophone, urumee and thavil drums, acoustic guitar and keyboards mixed with electronic synths and scratches. The vocals utilize the singing style of Tamil folk culture. Lyrically, the song revolves around the film's main actor being dumped by his girlfriend; the song is sung by the character in a drunken state, with many of the lines nonsensical. According to the composer, 3's director Aishwarya R. Dhanush wanted a light-hearted song about failed love. Ravichander quickly composed the tune in about 10 minutes.
